## Getting Started

This Challenge will require a video submission. Refer to the [Fullstack Blog Video Submission Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide) for additional guidance on creating a video.

Youâ€™ll need to use the [pg package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) to connect to your PostgreSQL database and perform queries, and the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) to interact with the user via the command line.

**Important**: You will be committing a file that contains your database credentials. Make sure that your PostgreSQL password is not used for any other personal accounts, because it will be visible on GitHub. In upcoming lessons, you will learn how to better secure this password, or you can start researching npm packages now that could help you.
